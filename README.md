# Number Theory
## Cryptography
I have implemented several cryptography algorithms from scratch not using libraries based on their whitepapers to gain a fuller appreciation and understanding of how they work, including encryption algorithms such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and hashing ones such as SHA256.
## Algorithms
I have written several number theory related algorithms, such as one to solve linear diophantine equations, and implementing standard ones such as the extended euclidean algorithm 
## Project Euler
I have complete several higher difficulty project euler number theory problems
